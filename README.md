# Study-Case-Satisfaction-Report---Power-BI
In the following repo I'll show you the process I've made with a DataCamp Study Case project step by step.

Hello world, here I am with one of the latest projects I've been evolved. The study case prensents a company called HS that wants to measure the satisfaction level of their workers. 
In that particular case we will be working with a vbery basic dataset where we'll find some dimentional tables that will be linked and refered to a fact table.

The skills we wuold have have are the following:

- Data modeling
- Power Query editor
- M language knowledge
- DAX language knowledge
- Report design
